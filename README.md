**Project Overview:**

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of historical stock price data for S&P 500 companies between January 2, 2014, and December 29, 2017. The goal is to uncover patterns, answer specific business questions, and draw investment insights from the dataset using Python.

**Project Scope:**

- Analyze trading volume trends across dates and weekdays
- Identify the most volatile day for Amazon (AMZN)
- Discover the most actively traded stocks on high-volume days
- Evaluate investment performance over time
- Deliver insights that could inform future trading or investment decisions.

**Business Objectives**

 - Determine peak trading activity periods
 - Understand which weekdays typically see more or less market activity
 - Identify potential investment opportunities based on historical growth
 - Analyze stock volatility for risk assessment

**Document Purpose**

This document outlines the steps taken to clean, analyze, and draw insights from the dataset. It serves as a reference for showcasing analytical thinking and Python programming skills for a data analyst portfolio.

**Use Case**

A potential investor or financial analyst could use this analysis to:

 - Time the market for better trading volume
 - Evaluate historical stock performance
 - Understand volatility in high-profile stocks like AMZN
 - Identify trends useful for portfolio strategy

**Data Source**

- Dataset: S&P 500 Stock Prices (2014–2017)
- Format: CSV
- Fields: symbol, date, open, high, low, close, volume
- Source: [Maven Analytics](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?dataStructure=Single%20table&order=number_of_records%2Cdesc)

**Data Overview**
 - Date Range: 2014-01-02 to 2017-12-29
 - Number of Companies: 500+ unique symbols
 - Key Metrics: Daily price (open, high, low, and close), trading volume
 - Total Records: ~1.5 million rows (based on date & symbol combinations.

**Data Cleaning and Processing**

 - Converted date column to date-time format
 - Extracted days of the week from dates
 - Handled grouped aggregations to compute total volumes and volatility
 - Calculated percentage gain from start to end of dataset per stock
 - Filtered records for specific dates (e.g., 2015-08-24, 2014-01-02, 2017-12-29)

**Recommendations**

 - Optimal Investment: Invest in the stock with the highest percentage gain over the period (identified during analysis)
 - High Volume Day Trading: Focus on Mondays if higher volume offers better liquidity
 - Risk Assessment: Use volatility insights (like Amazon’s most volatile day) for risk profiling
 - Market Monitoring: Watch for unusual spikes like the trading peak on August 24, 2015

**Conclusions**

This project demonstrates how Python can be used to analyze financial datasets, extract insights, and support investment decisions. The analysis uncovered key trends in trading volume, weekday patterns, and performance, providing valuable input for both novice and experienced investors.
